        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>"Working with Iron Thread Co. was a game-changer for our brand launch. We were nervous about getting the look and feel just right, but their design team nailed it from the first round of concepts. The shirts arrived looking even better than we imagined — soft, durable, and with vibrant prints that haven't faded after dozens of washes. Our customers keep asking where we got them made."</p>

            <div class="col">
                <p>"We needed merch for an upcoming festival and were on a ridiculously tight deadline. I honestly didn't expect anyone to take it on — but Iron Thread not only delivered on time, they delivered quality. Their team was responsive, friendly, and kept us updated every step of the way. The finished hoodies and tees sold out in two days. We've already placed another order!"</p>
                <p>&mdash; Maya T., Small Biz Owner</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>"We've worked with a few print shops before, but none that felt like true partners until Iron Thread. They took time to understand our audience and even gave recommendations on shirt styles we hadn't considered. The final product looked polished and professional — and our entire staff was thrilled with how they turned out. We'll be sticking with them for the long haul."</p>
